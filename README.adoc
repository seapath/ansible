== Introduction

The distribution debian iso generated by [build_debian_iso](https://github.com/seapath/build_debian_iso/) only contain the software preinstalled.

All the configuration (network, clustering, ...) is done with ansible playbooks found in the current repo.

Ansible allows you to play actions contained in Ansible playbooks to Linux
machines described with their settings in an Ansible Inventory.

The Ansible documentation is accessible at https://docs.ansible.com/.

== Prerequisites

Machines that need to be configured by Ansible simply need to provide SSH access
and have a Unix Shell and a Python interpreter. The hosts installed with the seapath debian iso already fit with
this requirements.

=== Use Ansible with cqfd

`cqfd` is a quick and convenient way to run commands in the current directory,
but within a pre-defined Docker container. Using `cqfd` allows you to avoids
installing anything else than Docker on your development machine.

NOTE: We recommend using this method as it greatly simplifies the build
configuration management process.

==== Install cqfd

* Install `docker` if it is not already done.

On Ubuntu, please run:

  $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

* Install `cqfd`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd.git
$ cd cqfd
$ sudo make install
```

The project page on https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd[Github] contains
detailed information on usage and installation.

* Make sure that `docker` does not require `sudo`

Please use the following commands to add your user account to the `docker`
group:

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in, so that your group membership can be re-evaluated.

==== Use cqfd

The first step with `cqfd` is to create the build container. For this, use the
`cqfd init` command in the Ansible directory:

  $ cqfd init

NOTE: The step above is only required once, as once the container image has been
created on your machine, it will become persistent. Further calls to `cqfd init`
will do nothing, unless the container definition (_.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile_) has
changed in the source tree.

User can now run commands through `cqfd` by using `cqfd run` followed by the
command to run. For instance

  $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml myplaybook.yaml

NOTE: Later you must prefix all ansible command with `cqfd run`.

=== Use Ansible without cqfd

Without `cqfd` you need to install the dependencies manually.
The client machine that is going to run Ansible must have Ansible 2.9 installed
an Inventory file and playbook files to play. To install Ansible 2.9 on this
machine please refer to the Ansible documentation at
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html.

*Warning:* Curently only the Ansible version 2.9 is supported. Other versions
will not work. Ansible 2.9 is the packaged version in Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 33.

Also you must also install the netaddr python3 module.

=== Additional components

You must install additional components. It can be done by running the
_prepare.sh_ script.

* With cqfd

```
$ cqfd -b prepare
```
* Without cqfd

```
$ ./prepare.sh
```

== Inventory

Ansible plays playbooks in hosts described in an Ansible inventory.
In this inventory are described the hosts, the way to access these hosts,
their configurations. Hosts can be grouped into groups.
Ansible Inventory documentation is available at
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html.

In the _examples/inventories_ directory you can find the file
_inventory_example.yaml_ which is a basic example file of Ansible inventory to
work with SEAPATH cluster composed of 2 hypervisors, an observer and a virtual
machine. This file is in YAML format.
Other formats are valid for inventory file but in this document we will only
cover the YAML format. This file also contains some commented examples of common
variables that can be used with Ansible, but does not contain the variables used
by the SEAPATH playbooks.

*Note:* If you are not familiar with the YAML format you will find a description
here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html

You need to pass your inventory file to all Ansible command with the `-i`
argument. To validate your Ansible inventory file you can use the
`ansible-inventory` command with `--list` argument.
For instance if your Ansible file is _cluster.yaml_:

 $ ansible-inventory -i cluster.yaml --list

An Ansible inventory file respects a hierarchy. Ansible actions can be later
applied to all hosts included in this level. All level can have *hosts* and
*vars* (variables).
The top level is *all*. *hosts* defined here are ungrouped and *vars* are
globals.
If you defined a *children* entry in *all* you can define a group.
For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
all:
    hosts:
        host1:
    vars:
        my_global_var: variable_content
    chlidren:
        group1:
            hosts:
                host2:
                host3:
            vars:
                my_group1_scope_variable: variable_content
        group2:
            hosts:
                host4:
                    my_host_variable: variable_content
----

Once you have an Ansible inventory you can test host connexion with the ping
module:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml all -m ping

Like all Ansible commands you need to specify your inventory file with the `-i`
argument, the host or group to apply the action.
For instance here we use the module ping with the `-m ping` argument.

To check all host in *group1*:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml group1 -m ping

To check only *host3*:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml host3 -m ping

In the _examples/inventories_ folder there is also another inventory example:
_advanced_inventory_example.yaml_. This example adds the variables with their
descriptions used by the SEAPATH playbooks. This inventory file should be used
as a starting point for writing your inventory file.

== Playbooks

Playbooks are files that will contain the actions to be performed by Ansible.
For more information about playbooks, see the Ansible documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks.html.
Ready-to-use playbooks are provided in this repository. Playbooks performing
specific actions such as importing a disk will have to be written by you,
referring if necessary to the playbook examples in the _examples/playbooks_
folder.

== Roles

To make writing playbooks easier and simpler, Ansible has set up roles that
allow you to group playbooks that can be reused later in other playbooks.

The playbooks useful for this project can be found in the _roles_ folder. Each
role contains a _README_ file describing its use.

Calling a role in a playbook is done as in the example below:

[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: hypervisors
  vars:
     - disk_name: disk
     - action: check
  roles:
     - seapath_manage_disks
----

For more information about roles see:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

== Using Ansible with SEAPATH in practice

=== Write your inventory file

Before you can start using playbooks to configure and manage your SEAPATH
cluster you need to write the inventory file describing your cluster. To do
this you can rely on the example files in the link:inventories[inventories] folder (see  link:inventories/README.md[inventories README.md] for more details).

You can place your own inventory file in the link:inventories[inventories] folder provided for this
purpose.

In the rest of the document we will consider that the cluster inventory file
will be called _cluster_inventory.yaml_ and that the network topology inventory is called networktopology_inventory.yaml_ and will both be placed in the _inventories_ folder.

=== Setting up the cluster

To set up the cluster you can use the playbook _cluster_setup_debian.yaml_ which
regroups the other playbooks.

To launch the playbook _cluster_setup_debian.yaml_ use the following command:

 $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml --skip-tags "package-install" playbooks/cluster_setup_debian.yaml

Or if you use `cqfd`:

 $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml --skip-tags "package-install" playbooks/cluster_setup_debian.yaml

The --skip-tags "package-install" is there for ceph-ansible no to try to install packages (they are already installed and if your host has no internet connection, it will make the playbook fail).

=== Hardening ===

SEAPATH cluster security can be improved by running the Hardening playbook
_playbooks/cluster_setup_hardened_debian.yaml_.

To launch the playbook _cluster_setup_hardened_debian.yaml_ use the following command:

 $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml playbooks/cluster_setup_hardened_debian.yaml

Or if you use `cqfd`:

 $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml playbooks/cluster_setup_hardened_debian.yaml


=== Generate SEAPATH Ansible modules documentation

The SEAPATH Ansible modules documentation can be generated using the command:

 $ cqfd -b module_documentation

The generated documentation is in HTML format and can be found in
_module_documentation/index.html_.


== Contributing to SEAPATH

=== Continuous integration on the Debian version

A CI is actually running on the debian-main branch. If you want to contribute to the project, this CI will launch your code to configure a cluster and run all non regression tests.

After opening your pull request, the CI is visible as a Github Action on the conversation page. A link to a test report is given at the end of the "Launch test" step. All tests must pass for the pull request to be merged.

For more information please see :
- [The Wiki](https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/SEAP/Continuous+integration+on+SEAPATH) for a user oriented guide.
- [The CI repository](https://github.com/seapath/ci) for technical implementation.

=== Ansible linter on the Debian version

Ansible-lint is run on every pull request toward the debian-main branch. Some rules are ignored, they can be found in the [configuration file](https://github.com/seapath/ci/blob/main/ansible-lint.conf) on the [CI repository](https://github.com/seapath/ci).
