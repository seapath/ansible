# This inventory can be customize using those fields :
#  * name: the VM name (string). Only on standalone. Default
#          inventory_hostname.
#  * uuid: the VM uuid (string). Only on standalone. Default is
#          autogenerated.
#  * description: the VM description (string). Default is "Test VM".
#  * vm_template: the VM template to use (string). Default is
#                 templates/vm/guest.xml.j2. In most cases, you should not
#                 change this.
#  * vm_features: the VM feature (list). Can contained one or more of the
#                 following items.
#    ** isolated: to enable CPU pinning
#    ** dpdk: to use link to VM with a OVS/DPDK bridge
#    ** rt: to enable real time tweaks
#  * cpuset: list of the CPU to use (int list). Use only with isolated.
#  * nb_cpu: the number of cpu to use when the vm is not isolated.
#            otherwise the length of cpuset is used. Optional (default : 1)
#  * memory: the memory to use in Mio (int). Default is 2048.
#  * pinned_host: the host to pin the VM (string). Optional. A pinned VM will
#                 never be migrated on another host.
#  * preferred_host: the host to prefer to run the VM (string). Optional. The VM
#                    will be run on this host if possible. If not, it will be
#                    run on another host.
#  * rt_priority: the FIFO scheduler priority (int). Default is 1. Use only
#                 with rt.
#  * pci_passthrough: a list containing dictionaries of the PIC devices to
#                     passthrough.
#    ** domain: PCI domain (int)
#    ** bus: PCI bus (int)
#    ** slot: PCI slot (int)
#    ** function: PCI function (int)
#  * sriov: a list containing the SRIOV pool to use (string list).
#  * bridges: a list containing dictionaries of the bridges to use.
#    ** name: the bridge name (string)
#    ** mac_address: the bridge MAC address (string)
#  * ovs: a list containing dictionaries of the OVS ports to use.
#    ** ovs_port: the OVS port name (string)
#    ** mac_address: the OVS port MAC address (string)
#  * apply_network_config: to apply the network configuration without rebooting
#    (bool).
