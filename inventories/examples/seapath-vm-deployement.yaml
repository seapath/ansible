# This inventory describes a virtual machine that will be deployed on a SEAPATH
# cluster or standalone machine.
# It gives two examples, the first on a critical (real-time) VM and the second
# on a standard VM.
#
# Be careful that SEAPATH only handles how to deploy and run the virtual machine.
# It does not handle any virtual machine inner configuration.
#
# Replace all the TODOs to fit your physical machines.
