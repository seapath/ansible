# Deploy VMs on standalone Seapath Role

Deploy all VMs on the inventory group *VMs* on a SEAPATH hypervisor.
This role do not deploy any VM in cluster mode.

## Requirements

No requirement.

## Role Variables

| Variable                                   | Required | Type   | Default                   | Comments                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| deploy_vms_standalone_qcow2tmpuploadfolder | No       | String | "/tmp"                    | Hypervisor directory to store VM disks temporarily while VMs are beeing created |
| deploy_vms_standalone_disk_pool            | No       | String | "/var/lib/libvirt/images" | Directory to store VM disks on the hypervisor                                   |
| deploy_vms_standalone_disk_copy            | No       | Bool   | true                      | Set true to copy the VM disk from the Ansible machine before created            |

The role uses the "VMs" group of the inventory. All members of this group will be deployed according to member's variable described below.
The Ansible member inventory host name will be used as VM name.

| *member*  variable | Required | Type   | Default | Comments                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vm_disk            | Yes      | String |         | Path to the VM disk in `qcow2` or `img.gz` (raw gzip compressed) format on the Ansible machine                    |
| vm_template        | Yes      | String |         | Path of the VM Libvirt XML file on the ansible machine. Warning, this must be a templated (jinja2) XML file       |
| force              | No       | Bool   | false   | Replace the VM if a VM with the same name is already deployed                                                     |
| disk_extract       | No       | Bool   | false   | Set to true if the disk is in `img.gz` (raw gzip compressed) format                                               |
| enable             | No       | Bool   | true    | Enable and start the VM after creating it                                                                         |

Here is an example of the structure for the VM inventory:

```yaml
VMs:
  hosts:
    myVM:
      vm_template: "../templates/vm/guest.xml.j2"
      vm_disk: "../files/guest.qcow2"
      force: true
      [...]
```

## Use a templated libvirt XML file

The `vm_template` variable point toward a jinja2 templated XML file.
If writing your own templated xml file, all the vm member variables are accessible using the `vm` variable. Ex : `"{{ vm.vm_disk }}"`
You can find an example of templated XML file in templates/vm/guest.xml.j2.

### Use the templated XML file guest.xml.j2

This templated XML file offers default behaviors and configurations to launch VMs on SEAPATH. It is mostly used for CI and demonstration on SEAPATH.
It can be a good starting point if you plan to deploy your VM on SEAPATH, however, for any production setup, it is recommended to create your own XML file.
Below is a list of the VMs member variables that can be used with this XML file. None of these variables are required.
