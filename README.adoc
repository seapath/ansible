== Introduction

The SEAPATH distribution images are generated and preconfigured on other repositories. However, some elements
cannot be statically configured during image creation or are specific settings that cannot be included in
a generic image

To perform these tasks we use Ansible which is a tool designed to configure
Linux machines.

The Ansible documentation is accessible at https://docs.ansible.com/.

The SEAPATH Ansible documentation is accessible on https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/seapath/ansible/[ansible galaxy].

This Readme only tackles how to handle the SEAPATH ansible sources and launch the default playbooks.
For any advanced scenarios and setup, refer to the https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEAP/overview?homepageId=31817739[SEAPATH Wiki].

=== Yocto

The images are generated in the https://github.com/seapath/yocto-bsp[yocto-bsp] repository.

Most of the configuration is done inside the yocto layers. This ansible repository is used to configure
- The network on each machine
- The high-availability cluster

=== Debian

The distribution debian iso generated by https://github.com/seapath/build_debian_iso/[build_debian_iso] only contain the software preinstalled.

All the configuration (network, clustering, ...) is done with ansible playbooks found in the current repo.

== Prerequisites

Machines that need to be configured by Ansible simply need to provide SSH access
and have a Unix Shell and a Python interpreter. Both Yocto and Debian SEAPATH images already fit with
this requirement.

=== Use Ansible with cqfd

`cqfd` is a quick and convenient way to run commands in the current directory,
but within a pre-defined Docker container. Using `cqfd` allows you to avoid
installing anything else than Docker on your development machine.

NOTE: We recommend using this method as it greatly simplifies the build
configuration management process.

==== Install cqfd

* Install `docker` if it is not already done.

On Ubuntu, please run:

  $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

* Install `cqfd`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd.git
$ cd cqfd
$ sudo make install
```

The project page on https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd[Github] contains
detailed information on usage and installation.

* Make sure that `docker` does not require `sudo`

Please use the following commands to add your user account to the `docker`
group:

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in, so that your group membership can be re-evaluated.

==== Use cqfd

The first step with `cqfd` is to create the build container. For this, use the
`cqfd init` command in the Ansible directory:

  $ cqfd init

NOTE: The step above is only required once, as once the container image has been
created on your machine, it will become persistent. Further calls to `cqfd init`
will do nothing, unless the container definition (_.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile_) has
changed in the source tree.

User can now run commands through `cqfd` by using `cqfd run` followed by the
command to run. For instance

  $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml myplaybook.yaml

NOTE: Later you must prefix all ansible command with `cqfd run`.

=== Use Ansible without cqfd

Without `cqfd` you need to install the dependencies manually.
The client machine that is going to run Ansible must have Ansible 2.10 installed
an Inventory file and playbook files to play. To install Ansible 2.10 on this
machine please refer to the Ansible documentation at
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html.

*Warning:* Currently only the Ansible version 2.10 is supported. Other versions
will not work.

Also you must also install the `netaddr` and `six` python3 module as well as the `rsync` package.

=== Additional components

You must install additional components. It can be done by running the
_prepare.sh_ script.

* With cqfd

```
$ cqfd -b prepare
```
* Without cqfd

```
$ ./prepare.sh
```

== Inventory

Ansible plays playbooks in hosts described in an Ansible inventory.
In this inventory are described the hosts, the way to access these hosts,
their configurations. Hosts can be grouped into groups.
Ansible Inventory documentation is available at
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html.

In the _inventories/examples_ directory you can find various examples for a seapath
cluster, a standalone machine and a virtual machine. See the https://github.com/seapath/ansible/tree/main/inventories#readme[associated README] for more information.

Other formats are valid for inventory file but in this document we will only
cover the YAML format. This file also contains some commented examples of common
variables that can be used with Ansible, but does not contain the variables used
by the SEAPATH playbooks.

*Note:* If you are not familiar with the YAML format you will find a description
here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html

You need to pass your inventory file to all Ansible command with the `-i`
argument. To validate your Ansible inventory file you can use the
`ansible-inventory` command with `--list` argument.
For instance if your Ansible file is _cluster.yaml_:

 $ ansible-inventory -i cluster.yaml --list

An Ansible inventory file respects a hierarchy. Ansible actions can be later
applied to all hosts included in this level. All level can have *hosts* and
*vars* (variables).
The top level is *all*. *hosts* defined here are ungrouped and *vars* are
globals.
If you defined a *children* entry in *all* you can define a group.
For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
all:
    hosts:
        host1:
    vars:
        my_global_var: variable_content
    children:
        group1:
            hosts:
                host2:
                host3:
            vars:
                my_group1_scope_variable: variable_content
        group2:
            hosts:
                host4:
                    my_host_variable: variable_content
----

Once you have an Ansible inventory you can test host connection with the ping
module:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml all -m ping

Like all Ansible commands you need to specify your inventory file with the `-i`
argument, the host or group to apply the action.
For instance here we use the module ping with the `-m ping` argument.

To check all host in *group1*:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml group1 -m ping

To check only *host3*:

 $ ansible -i cluster.yaml host3 -m ping


== Playbooks

Playbooks are files that will contain the actions to be performed by Ansible.
For more information about playbooks, see the Ansible documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/user_guide/playbooks.html.
Ready-to-use playbooks are provided in this repository.

== Roles

To make writing playbooks easier and simpler, Ansible has roles that
allow you to group tasks that can be reused in multiple playbooks.

In SEAPATH Ansible, most tasks performed by SEAPATH ready-to-use playbooks are packaged as roles.
The roles useful for this project can be found in the _roles_ folder. Each
role contains a _README_ file describing its use.
https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/seapath/ansible/docs/[A complete documentation of SEAPATH roles]
is available on Ansible galaxy.

Calling a role in a playbook is done as in the example below:

[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: hypervisors
  vars:
     - disk_name: disk
     - action: check
  roles:
     - seapath_manage_disks
----

For more information about roles see:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

== Using Ansible with SEAPATH in practice

First, make sure you are using the right release of SEAPATH.
For example, if you are working with SEAPATH v1.1.0:

  $ git checkout v1.1.0

If you want to work with the latest commits:

  $ git checkout main

=== Write your inventory file

Before you can start using playbooks to configure and manage your SEAPATH
cluster or standalone version, You need to write the inventory file describing your cluster. To do
this you can rely on the example files in the link:inventories/examples[inventories] folder (see link:inventories/examples/README.md[inventories README.md] for more details).

You can place your own inventory file in the link:inventories[inventories] folder provided for this
purpose.

In the rest of the document we will consider that the cluster inventory file
will be called _cluster_inventory.yaml_ and that the network topology inventory is called networktopology_inventory.yaml_ and will both be placed in the _inventories_ folder.

=== Set-up

To set up a SEAPATH machine you can use the playbook _seapath_setup_main.yaml_ which
regroups the other playbooks.
This playbook also configures the cluster on machines described in
cluster_machines Ansible group.

To launch the playbook _seapath_setup_main.yaml_ use the following command:

 $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/<your_cluster_inventory.yaml> playbooks/seapath_setup_main.yaml

Or if you use `cqfd`:

 $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventories/<cluster_inventory.yaml> playbooks/seapath_setup_main.yaml

=== Debian Hardening ===

When using SEAPATH Debian, the security features are applied with the hardening playbook
_playbooks/seapath_setup_hardened_debian.yaml_.
If you are using SEAPATH Yocto, the security features are already applied in meta-seapath at build time.

To launch the playbook _seapath_setup_hardened_debian.yaml_ use the following command:

 $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml playbooks/seapath_setup_hardened_debian.yaml

Or if you use `cqfd`:

 $ cqfd run ansible-playbook -i inventories/cluster_inventory.yaml -i inventories/networktopology_inventory.yaml playbooks/seapath_setup_hardened_debian.yaml

== Advanced usage

For advanced SEAPATH scenarios and configuration, refer to :

* The https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEAP/overview?homepageId=31817739[SEAPATH Wiki] explaining the use cases and the scenarios
* The seapath.ansible collection documentation on https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/seapath/ansible/[ansible galaxy] describing all the roles and variables.

== Contributing to SEAPATH

=== Continuous integration

A CI is actually running on the ansible repository. If you want to contribute to the project, this CI will launch your code to configure a cluster and run all non regression tests.

After opening your pull request, the CI is visible as a Github Action on the conversation page. A link to a test report is given in the step "Upload test report". All tests must pass for the pull request to be merged.

For more information please see :

* https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/SEAP/Continuous+integration+on+SEAPATH[The Wiki] for a user oriented guide.
* https://github.com/seapath/ci[The CI repository] for technical implementation.

=== Ansible linter

Ansible-lint is run on every pull request toward the debian-main branch. Some rules are ignored, they can be found in the https://github.com/seapath/ci/blob/main/ansible-lint.conf[configuration file] on the https://github.com/seapath/ci[CI repository].
