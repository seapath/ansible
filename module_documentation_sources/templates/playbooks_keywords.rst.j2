Playbook Keywords
=================

These are the keywords available on common playbook objects. Keywords are one of several sources for configuring Ansible behavior. See :ref:`general_precedence_rules` for details on the relative precedence of each source.


.. note:: Please note:

    * Aliases for the directives are not reflected here, nor are mutable one. For example,
      :term:`action` in task can be substituted by the name of any Ansible module.
    * The keywords do not have ``version_added`` information at this time
    * Some keywords set defaults for the objects inside of them rather than for the objects
      themselves
