# This inventory describes a virtual machine using advanced features for VM deployment.
# Basic configuration explained in "seapath-vm-deployement.yaml" are not re-explained here.
#
# Be careful that SEAPATH only handles how to deploy and run the virtual machine.
# It does not handle any virtual machine inner configuration.
#
# Replace all the TODOs to fit your physical machines, and see "seapath-vm-deployement.yaml" for
# basic configuration variables.
