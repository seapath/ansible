  - ceph-ansible
  - roles/systemd_networkd
  - roles/corosync
  - playbooks/update_machine_*
  - roles/yocto/kernel_params/tasks/tasks/soft_restart_machine.yaml

# ceph-ansible, systemd_networkd and corosync are submodules and seapath don't
# have control of them.
# Update playbooks take a machine name as environement variable. There is no
# way to pass it to ansible-lint, these playbooks must be ignored
# The soft_restart_machine.yaml is located in tasks directory and not in role.
# It works well with ansible, but for some reason, the linter try to find it in
# the roles directory.

skip_list:
  - yaml                   # yaml syntax warnings
  - unnamed-task           # All tasks should be named
  - role-name              # All role names should match "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$"
  - risky-file-permissions # All file creation must specify permissions
  - no-handler             # "when: result.changed" should trigger a handler instead
  - no-changed-when        # Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
  - no-relative-paths      # Doesn't need a relative path in role

### Why skip these warnings :
#
# - yaml errors are mostly "line >80 chars" and comment formatting. A yaml auto
# formatter could be run on the repository and would correct some problems.
# Reducing the length size requires a lot of reformatting work and isn't a big
# deal for now.
#
# - unnamed-task are all debugging task and thus not so important to name.
#
# - role-name doesn't seem too important to us.
#
# - risky-file-permissions concern a global cyber-security question : Specifying
# permissions on files must be done on the overall SEAPATH project in order to
# be effective. This is a much bigger task.
#
# - no-handler, no-changed-when and no-relative-paths should not be skipped. The
# raised warnings should be corrected as soon as possible for these three rules to
# run on the CI.
